# dvorak
This keyboard layout is an attempt to adapt the Dvorak layout to the following
constraints:
- Easy access to common programming symbols: (){}[]/<\> etc.
- Easy access to French symbols: éèêëàç etc. Other latin symbols may be present
  but are not the priority.
- No weird stuff with numbers _à la_ programmer's dvorak. I like my numbers in
  order.
- Emojis where there's room

It was mostly made using [Ukulele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele) with
manual intervention when necessary.

## Installation
- Copy file `julien_deoux_dvorak.keylayout` to `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`.
- Log out and log back in
- Option "Julien Déoux Dvorak" should appear in `System Settings > Keyboard >
  Text Input > Input Sources > Edit` under "Others"

## References
Ideas for this configuration were taken from these two projects:
- [Dvorak for Programmers with European Keys](https://github.com/asvd/programmer-dvorak-eu)
- [ThePrimeagen's custom layout](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/keyboards)

## Contributing/Licence and stuff
This is obviously tailored for my personal needs and I wouldn't expect anyone
to use it as-is, but feel free to take inspiration from it for your own
layout and maybe give suggestions if you have some which make sense with the
constraints stated above.
